The Pipeline is quite modular in nature following ```py37``` guidelines. It uses ```OOPs``` concepts which makes it quite robust and easy to debug.

I have tried to make this pipeline not too abstract, so that the user can have full control over it. The main goal of it is to help keep track of all the experiements in an organized way and automate repetitive tasks like creating folds, creating OOF and TEST predictions from an experiment.
